# Image-segmentation
Image segmentation using Kmeans.
 Image segmentation means that we can group
similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. The grouping
problem is a clustering problem. We want to study the use of K-means on the Berkeley
Segmentation Benchmark.

The data is available at the following link.

Every image pixel is a feature vector of 3-dimension {R,G,B}. We will use this feature
representation to do the segmentation.

a. We will change the K of the K-means algorithm between {3,5,7,9,11} clusters.
You will produce different segmentations and save them as colored images. Every
color represents a certain group (cluster) of pixels.
b. We will evaluate the result segmentation using F-measure, Conditional Entropy.
for image I with M available ground-truth segmentations. For a clustering of
K-clusters you will report your measures M times and the average of the M trials
as well. Report average per dataset as well.

In the previous parts, we used the color features RGB. We didnâ€™t encode
the layout of the pixels. We want to modify that for K-means clustering to
encode the spatial layout of the pixels
i. Modify the feature vector to include spatial
layout.
ii. Contrast the results you obtained by k means using RGB only to the results obtained
by considering the spatial layout.
